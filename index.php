			<p>It has been my honor to serve you as the judge of the 401st District Court for more than 15 years. In that time, I have presided over thousands of felony, family law and civil cases. While the facts of these cases vary greatly, my decision-making is always guided by my commitment to the rule of law. Each case must be judged on its individual facts and decided in a fair and impartial matter pursuant to the rule of law.</p>

			<p>I believe in the principles of the Republican Party. Prior to my election to the bench in 1996, I volunteered in county, state and national campaigns over a 20-year period. I have served as a delegate to senatorial district and state conventions.  </p>

			<p>I believe a judge’s role is to interpret the law, not to make the law. In my 19 years of service as a county and state judge, I have always remained true to this position, and I always will.  </p>

			<p>I respectfully ask for your support in the Republican Primary Election. </p>

			<h3>Unsolicited Testimonials about Judge Rusch</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					&#8220;I have had the privilege of continuously practicing in front of Judge Rusch since 1998. I have a criminal defense practice and have found that Judge Rusch has a very keen grasp on the criminal statutes and case law. He has an excellent judicial temperament and has a good blend of kindness and compassion yet he also has no problem being tough on the accused when the situation calls for it. In my opinion, the citizens of Collin County are very fortunate to have a judge with the experience and background that Judge Rusch brings to the bench. It is my understanding that Judge Rusch's opponent has no prior judicial experience and little or no criminal law experience. Judge Rusch has sat as either a county court at law judge or district judge for almost twenty years in Collin County. The 401st is not broken. It does not need to be fixed. Don't replace 20 years of level, well rounded judicial experience with someone who has none.&#8220;

				<p>I have had the privilege of knowing and working with this good man since the first day he went to work in the District Attorney's office. His professionalism and integrity have been integral in his deportment since that time until now. This County has been blessed to have a man of Judge Ruschs' character and morality serving as a Judge. This honorable and God fearing man is someone whom I endorse and strongly suggest you cast your vote for in the upcoming election. Our courts are open to the public and I would recommend that if you want to see a venue where the highest standards of proper judicial decorum is on display daily that you might take the time to visit the 401st Judicial District Court.

					&#8220;In criminal law, having a knowledgeable and experienced judge means justice and fairness to both the State and the accused. In that respect, Judge Rusch wins hands down. In family law, having a judge who has seen it all means fairness to the divorcing couple and the protection of the children in the divorce. In this realm, Judge Rusch is second to none. Yes, experience does matter.&#8220;

					&#8220;I had the honor of having jury duty this week and was fortunate enough to do my service in Judge Mark Rusch's Court. I had never served on a jury panel before and really didn't know what to expect. Judge Rusch made all the 120+ panel members feel at home, explained the process to us and gave us the utmost confidence that he cared about each of us and the litigants. It was an extremely serious criminal case and we were all confident with Judge Rusch's background and experience in criminal law that each side would be given a fair trial. We stayed at the courthouse until almost 7 p.m. to allow each side their opportunity find the best jurors for the case. I feel very blessed to live in a county with such a great Judge. I ask all of my friends to vote for Judge Rusch in this upcoming election. He has proven over the years to be not only a great Judge but a true public servant for the citizens of Collin County.&#8220;

					&#8220;I have known Judge Rusch since 1984 when he taught me how to be a prosecutor. We tried many cases together as a team for the Collin County District Attorney's office. I owe a great deal to Judge Rusch for his assistance in helping me make the transition from a police officer to a trial lawyer. Judge Rusch has always been fair on the bench to both sides. He has always listened and considered the arguments of both the State and Defense. He is even tempered with a great judicial persona. The last thing we need is to lose Judge Rusch. And that is not going to happen.&#8220;

					&#8220;It has been my privilege to serve the 401st Court in Collin County as a Receiver.  Judge Rusch combines keen intellect, unimpeachable integrity and a remarkably high degree of human insight into the fulfillment of his duties.  His commitment to the rule of law is absolute and he is a fine representative of Collin County.  I unconditionally and wholeheartedly endorse the re-election of Judge Rusch.&#8220;

					&#8220;We have both appeared as attorneys in Judge Rusch’s court.  You can count on him to follow the law and “get it right.”  He always takes extra time to provide advice, mentorship, and support for attorneys.  This is not something he has to do, but something he just does because he is passionate about his job and the profession of law.&#8220;
