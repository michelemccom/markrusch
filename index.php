			<p>It has been my honor to serve you as the judge of the 401st District Court for more than 15 years. In that time, I have presided over thousands of felony, family law and civil cases. While the facts of these cases vary greatly, my decision-making is always guided by my commitment to the rule of law. Each case must be judged on its individual facts and decided in a fair and impartial matter pursuant to the rule of law.</p>

			<p>I believe in the principles of the Republican Party. Prior to my election to the bench in 1996, I volunteered in county, state and national campaigns over a 20-year period. I have served as a delegate to senatorial district and state conventions.  
			I believe a judgeâ€™s role is to interpret the law, not to make the law. In my 19 years of service as a county and state judge, I have always remained true to this position, and I always will.</p>

			<p>I respectfully ask for your support in the Republican Primary Election. </p>

			<p> &mdash; Mark Rusch</p>
